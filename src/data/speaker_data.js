    "TalkTitle":"Session on Internet Services",
    "Abstract": "Internet services is a complex economic interaction between three key actors: Content providers (CPs), consumers, and Internet service providers. Quality of the user experience in networked applications is, traditionally considered the responsibility of the Internet service provider (ISP). The ISPs though face the triple whammy of increasing demands on network resources, shorter technology lifecycles resulting in more frequent infrastructure investments, and a very cost sensitive customer base. Smart pricing schemes can help extract some of the consumer surplus. Net neutrality and other regulations are forcing ISPs to find innovative ways of extracting the CP side surplus.  In this talk we will explore some of the ways in which the ISPs are able to provide improved user experience and have CPs pay for their investment in the infrastructure. Using microeconomic models we will then analyse the effect on the CP market structure.",

    "Abstract": "Traditional network switches and routers are configurable, but not programmable. They can only perform a small set of hard-wired and specific network layer activities.  The advent of programmable data planes (PDP), realized using hardware switches, and the Programming Protocol-independent Packet Processors (P4) language enable a switch to be customizable and field-programmable.  In this talk, we will briefly the PDP and P4 concepts including the switch architectures and high-level language constructs. We will then describe how these can be used to realize next generation network switches/routers and advanced network applications.",
